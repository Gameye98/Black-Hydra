This program is just a small program to shorten brute force sessions on hydra :)
But to be more satisfying results of the brute force. You better interact directly with hydra,
without having to use this black hydra console first: ').
If you find any errors in running our program. Can chat via telegram :).
Hydra is needed for the process of this program :).
